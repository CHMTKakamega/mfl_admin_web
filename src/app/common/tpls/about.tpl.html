                        <p>The Master Facility List is an initiative managed by the Division of Health Information Systems (HIS) of the Ministry of Public Health and Sanitation and the Ministry of Medical Services in Kenya.
                        A large number of Ministry Divisions, Departments, Counties, Sub Counties and Partners have collaborated:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Information in the database is updated by the SCHRIOs whenever a new facility passes inspection by the Sub-County to offer services.  In future, the national regulatory bodies will be updating the licensing, registration and gazettement information on facilities.</li>
                            <li>Health Information Systems and the Department of Standards and Regulatory Services worked with many government divisions and partners to provide the definitions contained in the “Master Facility List Implementation Guide”</li>
                            <li>The MFL website has been developed by <a href="http://savannahinformatics.com/" target="_blank">Savannah Informatics.</a> </li>
